# PEEK

PEEK is a website used to find television shows or films that are worthy of binge watching. PEEK displays the pilot episodes and movie trailers of popular shows. After watching the pilot or trailer, the user has the option of clicking like or dislike. 'Liking' a video adds the show to the user's watchlist and provides the user with streaming services to the series or film.'Disliking' a video will show another trailer or pilot episode for the user to view. The website will display relevant information pertaining to the video such as the leading actors/actress. Additionally, the site sports a 'Connections' list. The connections list consist of users who have liked the particular video the user is currently watching. The user can then view that persons profile and have the option of adding them as a friend.
